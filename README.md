Flametender is a challenging action platformer with flame-based mechanics.
You are one of the last of the Flametenders; humans with the extraordinary ability to create and control flame. Though you are gifted,
there are many who wish to rid the world of those with such powers. Can you survive in a world where everyone is out to get you?

*This is a very early demo; mostly a proof-of-concept of the mechanics. Feel free to leave feedback though!*

-Press the ESC key to exit the game at any time.
-Press backspace to reset a room if you get stuck in a wall or something (do this at your own risk, it can cause some super weird issues).
-Press UP on the D-PAD (XBOX) or TAB (keyboard) to activate DEBUG MODE. This gives you unlimited Flame and you don't lose Life when you
get hurt or fall. Using this is just for playing around with the mechanics, though. Don't be a dirty cheater.
