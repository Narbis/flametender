Features to Implement:
-Multi-directional attacks
-More basic enemies
-Human enemies more interesting
-Fire-based puzzles (melting ice, lighting torches, burning brush, etc)
-Actual levels
-Bosses

Ideas:
-Progression via combat VS progression via platforming
	-Combat involves fighting enemies to proceed, killing enemies restores flame
	-Platforming allows the player to avoid fighting by being sneakier, less fighting means flames can be used for saving when needed
-Bosses have special abilities that the player gets when defeating them
	-Killing absorbs the ability, or you can let the boss use their flame attacks to wear themselves out then use a special power to take their power
